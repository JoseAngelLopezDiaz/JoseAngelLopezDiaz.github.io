            Dear anonymous unknown. It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to my humble little website. I am nothing but an amateur flute, ping pong, and chess player, who happens to actively enjoy engineering and languages. I created this site to keep a record of my personal goals and achievements. Hope you like it!
        </p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>I can fluently speak Spanish, English, French, Italian and I'm learning a little bit of German and Russian too. I'm just bored, it's no wonder that this webpage even exists.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion-btn">My book</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>Little progress here. It is said that in life you must at least write a book, have a son and plant a tree. At least I've already done the third one. I´m still working on the second chapter.</p>

                <p>Still learning, I'm not something of a musician myself, at least, yet.</p>

            <button class="accordion-btn">Engiineering professional career</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>I´m a passionate engineer, but still in college, though. I study in the Escuela Politécnica Superior de Belmez (EPSB), and I pre-registered in a professional mining association.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion-btn">Pico y pala Engineering</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>At some point for some reason I thought that it would be a nice idea to create a YouTube channel where I can stand up on behalf of the mining industry, for it has been unfarily given a bad reputation throughout the years.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion-btn">Chess</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>Over the past few years i´ve assisted several tournaments, all of them for amateurs, without elo rating. I guess my highest achievement here is playing and winning an amateur wolrd champion, who also happened to be my math teacher in college.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion-btn">Politics and student representation</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>I´ve always been attracted by the wolrd of politics, and so I joined the student council, made my way to vice presidency, and ended up involved in so many positions that it´s hard to enumerate them. Wherever I went I defended with fierceness the interests of my faculty. I was told I kind of have a gift for words, and so I pursued a career inside a political party, starting by an afiliation.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion-btn">Volunteering</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>After a few events collaborating with the AECC (Spanish Association Against Cancer by its acronym in Spanish) I decided i liked what they do, an so I joined them.</p>
            </div>

            
            <button class="accordion-btn">Ping pong</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>It was during my teenage times that I realized it was important to make some sport now and then, so I started playing football as a goalkeeper, spent some years getting to know local teams. But it wasn´t until I reached college that I developed devotion for pin pon, since it was the perfect sport to play between classes; not too complicated, can be plaid wearing jeans... Everyday the pin pon table was there for me. Eventually I became the EPSB´s champion.</p>

            <button class="accordion-btn">F&F (Friends and Family)</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>But all theese accomplishments come nowhere near my biggest attainment and that of wich i feel most proud of; my family and my friends. They really make live worth living, and make every instatnt be worthy.</p>
